title: Music That Moves Me

With 2025 now in full swing, it has so far been a time of forward-thinking and goal-setting. The end of a year, however, is usually the opposite. It is a time of introspection, reflection, and most importantly, celebration. As I reflected, I marveled at how so much has changed. Not much remains constant, but one of the few things that does, at least in my life, is music. I am of the impression that music is the centerpiece of everything. There’s not a single moment in this life that can’t be defined by a song. Music has the power to quantify feelings and thoughts when simple words fail. So with that said, I thought it appropriate to take some time in my yearly rumination to pay homage to the musical genres that have enhanced my life recently, and maybe have impacted yours as well.

The energetic intensity of EDM perfectly illustrates all of the chaotic happenings of life. Every drop of the base in songs like [“Honey” by Caribou](https://youtu.be/yC0r8RCYyvY?si=qRh0OrmqANvaEyCy) or [“Edge” by Rezz](https://youtu.be/2oIAQSUt9mo?si=c9SKrfEf7R3NZfS7) seems to mirror all the emotional and physical highs and lows. The fresh, innocent energy in [Fred Again..’s Boiler Room set](https://youtu.be/c0-hvjV2A5Y?si=IkvAue8UxYWPqGYo) is a symbol of revitalization as I continuously try to break up the monotony of day-to-day life. [Watching CloZee stream her set at home with her dog in a cozy space with the sun slowly setting in the background](https://www.youtube.com/live/EnYmqdQA73s?si=kD7NeUE3QSVSYcfs) painted a picture of security and a safe space to lock into a passion project, which gives me the energy to focus on my own creative outlets. [Four Tet](https://youtu.be/Ca6pjR2TLns?si=uDiyvRIvZznC29Yl), [INZO](https://youtu.be/luQSQuCHtcI?si=mCS3fm1zdvjNSqjz) and [Louis the Child](https://youtu.be/PTz2xKKAclg?si=Nuf3cUjfOnsIGJvH) motivates me on my runs, giving life to the fall and winter Seattle gloom and making the sunny summer days feel even brighter.  I am especially drawn to songs that have an emotional aspect, such as those of Fred Again.. Most dance genres give listeners the chance to simply escape and let go, which I appreciate. However, I keep finding myself coming back to a place of deep introspection, and am drawn to songs like Fred Again..’s that provides the necessary escapism from the outside world, but also an opportunity to dive deep into the subconscious and access a state of being that uniquely juxtaposes the high-energy with the meditative. [Fred Again.., or Fred Gibson, says in an interview](https://www.rollingstone.co.uk/music/fred-again-actual-life-interview-16307/) that he craves the “intimacy and the humanity” of music, which I have similarly found myself needing more of from the electronic genre rather than the mindless, repetitive “wub-wub”.



<center><b> Atmospheric/Ambient </b></center>

I first started to appreciate the complexity and diversity of this genre after spending days sprawled out on the floor of my room writing my master’s thesis last year. When I recall ambient or atmospheric music now I don’t think of those classic nature sounds like ocean waves crashing against the shore, or droning white noises playing on repeat. I think of Grouper’s [“Alien Observer”](https://youtu.be/eVqFnuaW4JQ?si=r5OJYpRCSher-NeL) or [“Poison Tree”](https://youtu.be/6gnKBDlJutA?si=vMLP66UzUEQb6ISx), with melancholy tones and desperate vocals seemingly filling an empty void in outer space. Or Ethel Cain’s haunting melodies in the album *[Preacher’s Daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w48dgEpUOAY&list=PLI6kLIhBBwmSdjKUR0GgKuAu7j3uhcZJZ)*, each song coming together to tell a story of a naive young girl’s misadventures whilst traveling across America. The dark, lonely, mysterious undertones in these songs would likely unsettle most people. But as I sat there in my room slowly losing my mind over my thesis, they only had a calming effect, seeming to ground me and help me focus as I let the words flow. The artists I’m referencing perhaps represent a more bold and experimental sub-genre, but the ephemeral elements are there nonetheless. Even Aphex Twin, who masterfully captures the electronic genre as well and gathers inspiration from many other styles, has created [multiple volumes of albums containing treasure troves of ambient music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i524g6JMkwI&list=PLZLc0F94U2D2RHnF01I42PykVfaTQkd-y) that I have come to love. 



<center><b> Latin </b></center>

*“1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7”*, is the mantra I repeat to myself as I attempt to keep up the illusion of elegance, my mind-body connection being endlessly tested. Six hours in, all I know is sweat and dizziness as I am continuously getting spun around by other dancers, my ability to follow signals slowly waning due to exhaustion. This was my first time dancing to Latin music, at least my first time dancing to it properly without just bopping my head around at a club. Salsa, bachata, meringue: I learned the basics to all of these in just one night. Eventually the need for fresh air gave way, and I trudged through the crowd to let in the chilled, early-spring Boston air. It was in that moment that I realized I felt alive, buzzed by the dopamine that had built up in body from the dance. 

I went back home and eventually made a hobby of this, eager to learn more and meet new people. Dancing is something I’ve always enjoyed, but I never stopped to appreciate the connection you feel and the skills you pick up when you’re dancing with other people. As a follow, I’ve learned to be more observant, pick up on social cues, and strengthen my mind-body connection that was left dormant for so long. There has even been [extensive research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5267615/#abstract1) on how partner dancing has many benefits such increasing neuroplasticity, social functioning, and overall mental and physical wellbeing. 



<center><b> Indie </b></center>

Indie music is a symbol of freedom, independence, and daring to think differently. [I wrote a post a while back about the history of this genre and how it has evolved over the decades](https://solariachip.com/indie/). The same artists and songs I mentioned in that post are ones still I listen to religiously, and since then I’ve added new ones to the list. Artists such as [Current Joys](https://youtu.be/-ETAWC8pKww?si=qgKbL7RfQtGNX4i5), [CASTLEBEAT](https://youtu.be/16Rbi3MgOXc?si=rjY4chhdCuhWg2sK), [Logan Bowden](https://youtu.be/VDvPuRAsxuI?si=82m1mPIzUw3JVE67), and [Husbands](https://youtu.be/FL8gi0tSCNE?si=KAyNeEoa7KatmoBo) have made it into almost every playlist. Not only do I love this genre, I love what it stands for and symbolizes. It reminds me to stay wild, keep finding myself, and not let the demands of society bog me down. After living in Seattle with a thriving indie music scene, I believe that it’s even possible to create your own little community around indie music, as diverse as the genre is. 

>“If music be the food of love, play on.” -William Shakespeare 

Music is the universal language. It is something we can all understand, and unites us even when differences threaten to divide us. I now invite you to reflect on how moves you — both physically and metaphorically — and let it connect you to yourself and others.
