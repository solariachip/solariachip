Demonstrating and practicing confidence is a seemingly tall order with the proliferation of great successes algorithmically presented to us on a daily basis. 
Achievements are celebrated but failed iterations are footnotes. Unsurprisingly, lacking confidence, or lacking *trust* (from the Latin root *fidere*) in oneself has sowed the seeds of imposter syndrome, inferiority complex, insecurity, and self-doubt in our culture. The self is excessively deluded to lose faith with each enterprise, further fueling this divination. Women tend to struggle with this to a greater and broader extent from systematic chauvinism, a lack of role models (read my list [here](https://solariachip.github.io/Madames/)), and society's obsession with shallow undertakings.

To that end, I lament that [a mental health crisis among young girls](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/analysis-theres-a-mental-health-crisis-among-teen-girls-here-are-some-ways-to-support-them) threatens our future leaders, scientists, and creative minds deteriorating under the critical gaze of omnipotent social networking platforms. Instead of collaborating on ideas, tackling crucial modern inadequacies and injustice, or forming meaningful relationships with one another, an emphasis is placed on getting views and likes on the perfect photo or reel. While the "selfie" can portray self-empowerment and confidence, the overall impact to humankind is a pretense harboring undesirable competition and prevalently, a negotiation with societal standards of physical beauty. 

You might find it hard to believe (at least my mom, a source of requited love, did) that I struggle with confidence. Growing up in California, I was surrounded by blue-eyed blondes with tall, slim legs while the media flaunted Kate Moss and Heidi Klum. As I "matured" and started caring more about my appearance, I began to resent my differences that were actually desired by men and women alike. Despite the bewildering attention and constant affirmation I received from strangers, I would still find things to nit-pick and criticize about myself. I do not wish to trivialize the issue of confidence with my own experience--my privilege is an adbridgement to the real quandary of our personal values and on society's as a whole. 

René Descartes in *The Passion of the Soul* revisits his grand adage: "I think, therefore I am" to the lesser known "I regard with compassion, therefore I am". 

Self-esteem, in alignment to my idea of confidence, is the replete regard of the identity fulfilled by invaluable lessons and distinguished experiences in agreement with my principles. True self-esteem is not an external attribute nor does it become embodied from having followers or admirers as I can attest... Only you can identify and testify your own excellence and farther yet your mark on this world. This is a daily practice.

Self-doubt, on the other hand, can be measured with higher-order evidence on the basis of [epistemic philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-self-doubt/#WhatWoulMaxiRatiSubjDo), in which exists first-order beliefs and second-order beliefs (the belief within) that may provide rational calibrations to a set of practical scenarios. The approximation befalls onto Bayesian convergence theorems, which "tells us that if the world isn't systematically deceptive then the misleading [defeaters](https://academic.oup.com/book/39499/chapter-abstract/339301672?redirectedFrom=fulltext) will be washed out, that is defeated by some other evidence, in the long run." Roughly speaking, the conditions of self-doubt can be rational and even emboldened. However, I am beginning to dive into the realm of [defeasible reasoning](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-defeasible/) as an argument for subjugating moral perplexities with impenitent logic. 

Perhaps these are the ramblings from someone who has grown tired and anxious over the percipience of prepossessing the unrelenting gaze of others. *With confidence* nothing I am saying is original: you should believe in your abilities, forget the haters (the modern day defeater, I might add), and practice this daily. 

Here are some things I'm working on that helps me establish more confidence:

✵ Helping others \
I can't think of better way to demonstrate competence and knowledge than *selflessly* supporting and helping someone else.

✵ Smelling good \
I like to rotate the "Soph smell" every so often or depending on the season.

✵ Doing hard things \
Each iterations cultivates improvement and percolates resilience.

✵ Wearing flattering and comfortable clothes \
Know what works for your body. Certain shades of pink throw off my natural/season color palette and mid-calf boots, though I love them, are usually not a good fit for me. Doc Martens, though, definitely make me feel badass.

✵ Mastering small talk \
It's a necessary skill that will get you far in life. For a long time, this fell under "doing hard things" but it deserves special recognition for the way that it can get a smile out of everyone and has led to amazing conversations and opportunities.

✵ Being grateful and being kind \
The former allows me to stay grounded and the latter works wonders against the defeaters, including yourself.

✵ Being silly \
Don't hold back.
