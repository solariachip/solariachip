We are completely overjoyed to release the first article of *Solaria Chip* on the [International Day of Happiness](https://www.un.org/en/observances/happiness-day), which also coincides with World Storytelling Day during Women's History Month. 

This first Chip somewhat poses a challenge for me as I have a complex history with my internal struggle for happiness and a profoundly personal account that I could share at length, coupled with the fact I have no real experience in writing beyond scientific purposes. Perhaps befittingly; however, I welcome challenges and take joy in confronting them in order to gain a deeper understanding.

Depression is one of them. Genetically dispositioned for it and easily influenced by things I cannot control such as weather, the actions of others, and to some extent, my environment--my battle against it often feels like the myth of Sisyphus, condemned to roll a boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down again. On the bright side, one of the benefits of living with chronic major depression for more than half my life is that I became increasingly aware of when I was unhappy and highly analytical of the possible reasons for it. When I felt better (and provided I had any energy after the fact), I would take as much action to work towards improving this aspect and quality of life. 

In *Commentary to The Secret of the Golden Flower*, psychoanalyst Carl Jung observes that 
> “the greatest and most important problems of life are all in a certain sense insoluble. They can never be solved, but only outgrown... Some higher or wider interest arose on the person’s horizon, and through this widening of view, the insoluble problem lost its urgency. It was not solved logically in its own terms, but faded out when confronted with a new and stronger life-tendency."

I solved the initial problem with my first career in Production and Engineering where I spent 8 dreadful hours feeling like I was going nowhere, while also dealing with sexual harrassment on a day-to-day basis. I took a risk by being unemployed for the first time, until almost serendipitously a career in Astronomy was offered to me... across the country. I sold my car, donated more than half of my belongings, and began my adventure on the opposite coast almost a year ago. 

I had to start over in finding my happiness. In California, where I had lived all of my life since immigrating from the Philippines, I had a potent dose of Vitamin D paired with the salty air on the coastline and a sick circle of friends and connections. There was always something going on every weekend, and if I needed to escape, the landscapes easily transformed between lush evergreen forests or vast mountain deserts that reinvigorated my sense of awe in nature. 

During the first months in my new surroundings, I was homesick constantly and falling into depressive habits frequently. I was failing to establish meaningful relationships and found it difficult to make friends, which had never been an issue despite being a true ambivert. It also seemed to me that practically every social gathering involved alcohol, and before long I developed a drinking problem and an inflamed liver. For the first time, the boundaries between anxiety and depression were made evidently distinct, as both were now part of my entourage. I grew weary spending my days in self contempt and neglect. And my hair. My silky hair that had never needed brushing was starting to form knots from spending too many days in bed. I took some scissors and cut it to a bob, which also meant that I had to look in a mirror.

In *The Conquest for Happiness*, mathematician Bertrand Russell writes:
> The world is vast and our own powers are limited. If all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give. And to demand too much is the surest way of getting even less than is possible. The man who can forget his worries by means of a genuine interest in, say, the Council of Trent, or the life history of stars, will find that, when he returns from his excursion into the impersonal world, he has acquired a poise and calm which enable him to deal with his worries in the best way, and he will in the meantime have experienced a genuine even if temporary happiness.

Here are some of the things that invoke happiness, when all else seems to fail (in no particular order):
* seeing the ocean
* a corny but good joke
* music
* followed by dancing
* flowers
*
