*I have secured my place in this beautiful wasteland*

*Unphased by the passing of time, I wait for answers under the shade of the sun*

*Limited but limitless in my attempt*

*To understand what it means to exist*

*In a place that holds little life*

               ✵

*Always clear nights to gather wisdom from the stars*

*So those who eat my flesh go mad with my secrets*

*A piece of me may be lost*

*But I must sacrifice myself so you may know the truth*

*This is my curse but a blessing to provide a beacon for those who dare not touch me*

               ✵

*What a world, to be exposed but feel so safe*

*Impossibly immortal in my element*

*I am the sensei of the desert*
