> Hello again, to all my friends \
Together we can play some rock and roll

I remember sitting on the grass freshman year one lunch period with a pair headphones, scrolling through my invariant library when a friend of mine passed by, donning earbuds jacked into his own music player. I watched as he began to propel his head quite subtly forwards, sometimes side to side, but overtly enjoying whatever he was listening to. I took a seat next to him, asking what was playing. With a knowing glance, he yanked one side of his buds out and handed it to me. "*Bro,* have you heard this guy? He makes dubstep."

Sonny Moore, aka [Skrillex](http://skrillex.com), pioneered my life and the future of electronic dance music as the 21st century graduated into its first decade. At the same time I got my first smartphone, I was always downloading the top hits I heard on the radio, classic and alt-rock influences from my parents, and a handful of old school hip hop and R&B throwbacks from growing up in Oakland, CA. Somewhat of an eccentricity in my early repertoire, like a jewel hidden between rock, I treasured the *Discovery*  album I ripped from my mom's original iPod by the French duo [Daft Punk](https://www.daftpunk.com) and a bit later found the "église" of [Justice](https://justice.church). In middle school, I danced to Austrialian [DJ S3RL](https://djs3rl.com/)'s hardcore and hyper melodies, while I searched everywhere for the lyrics *"Vi sitter i Ventrilo och spelar DotA"* belonging to Swedish singer and producer [Basshunter](http://basshunter.se/). I loitered in my friend's cool older brother's room, hoping he would play more of Japanese DJ [Shinichi Osawa](https://www.shinichi-osawa.com/)'s bright, bouncy beats. With limited resources at the time, feeding my affinity for artificial rhythms and their distinct ingenuity to harmonize with our primal desires to dance and move was a fickle task. Maybe it was good timing that American EDM was catching up with the rest of the world by the time I turned 18 and started frequenting shows and festivals. 

Skrillex ignited this evolution under [mau5trap](https://mau5trap.com) with his two EPs *Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites* and *More Monsters and Sprites*, instating dubstep's emphemeral popularity with listeners in the US (coined brostep) as he topped 2011 music charts and reached the eardrums of high schoolers like me and my friend. He has won eight Grammy awards, holding the record for any electronic dance music artist. Formerly 1/2 of Jack Ü, Skrillex has collaborated with the likes of Diplo and Justin Bieber, winning him one of those awards in 2015 with *Where Are Ü Now*'s convergence between trap, pop, and EDM. By 2014, Skrillex marked [the culmination of dubstep's success](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pg8n7m/dubstep-may-be-dying-just-dont-tell-canadians-that) with *Recess*; the album title's name a reflection of his [break](https://twitter.com/skrillex/status/1614874515653431299?s=46&t=ygCc01ttpbd0obS6Mw0Sfg) from substantial projects. Meanwhile, the likes of [Calvin Harris](https://calvinharris.com), [Zedd](https://www.zedd.net), [David Guetta](https://davidguetta.com), and [The Chainsmokers](http://thechainsmokers.com) were emerging in the mainstream after Skrillex's wake. These artists found their success back in the more temperate subgenres of dance-pop and house, methodically featuring timeless icons such as Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Sia, Nicki Minaj, and Coldplay. Skrillex continued to make singles and collaborate with music titans both in the US and overseas. As contemporary mainstream mutates and diversifies, Skrillex adapts his sound to accomodate to demand, both drawing in new fans and drawing back earlier generations. 

After more than nine years, Skrillex released *Quest for Fire* and *Don't Get Too Close* in tandem last month in February. He gave the EDM community a taste with the initial release of *Rumble*, a potent collaboration between trail-blazing prodigy [Fred again...](https://www.fredagain.com) propelled by MC Flowdan's heavy and menacing vocals. Coalescencing to the rest of *QfF*'s track list, Skrillex's 2023 studio album percolates with house-forward rhythm and style leading the latest EDM today. Analagous to the rollercoaster that EDM really is, *RATATA* features Missy Elliot's effervescent intonations that amplify its kinetic groove, while the interlude *Warped Tour '05 with pete WENTZ* pays tribute to his roots in emo rock and rap, solidified in *Don't Get Too Close*.

Skrillex's debut back into EDM, perhaps a reinvention, is a merely one permutation of his seminal and authentic identity as an artist. [In an interview with Future Music](https://www.musicradar.com/news/classic-interview-skrillex), Skrillex divulges tips and tricks to budding DJs and composers, along with the that he has made any adjustments to his gear setup since *Kill Everybody* and uses accessible software and tools. 

Daniel J. Levitin, author of [*This Is Your Brain On Music*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/298964/this-is-your-brain-on-music-by-daniel-j-levitin/), reveals the "parlor trick" prevalent throughout Western classical music called "deceptive cadence". Cadence indictes a chord sequence that establishes a predictable pattern until the rhythm breaks with a completely unexpected chord. Like a true composer, Skrillex continues to deliver this method comprehending the main structural elements of the intro, breakdown (percussion drop out), build up (rising pitch or faster percussion), and the notorious drop (high point of the song). Welcome back Skrillex, I'm ready to Rumble.
