In honor of [Earth Day](https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2023/), and feeling quite reminiscent, I decided to put together a photo collage of all the places I’ve been in the last few years that encapsulate Earth’s natural beauty. From my travels to some of the Earth’s coastlines, to coming across wildlife in blissful hikes in the wilderness, I know that there is so much our planet has to offer. But in order to experience this, I believe it is everyone’s responsibility to give back to the natural world. This transactional relationship between us and our planet needs to exist in order for there to be balance between humans and nature. Here are some things that we should be reminding ourselves today as we reflect on the role we all play on this Earth:

* Remember to bring reusable bags with you whenever you go shopping to help reduce the use of plastic

* The same goes for reusable water bottles

* Always ask yourself  “Can this be recycled?”

* This should be common sense, but don’t litter!

* Thrift shopping reduces the impact on the planet (and your wallet too)

* Bike, walk, or take public transportation whenever possible (cars are great but they’re also bad for the environment…)

* If you live in an area prone to drought, be mindful of how much water you’re using

* Get out in nature more!  Seeing Earth’s natural beauty firsthand will make appreciate it so much more.
