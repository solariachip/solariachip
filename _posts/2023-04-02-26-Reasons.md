I don't care to celebrate the day of my own birthday. Six months ago, my initial plans were carelessly cancelled so I went to dinner with a few coworkers, who were unaware of the occasion until I conceded at the very last minute. Five and a half years ago, I experienced a panic attack while my college boyfriend at the time settled into a video game for the night. These first world problems motivated me to doubt the satisfaction and lessons with growing old. It was only over these past six months that I made up those years of staying immature and bitter that I celebrated my life for what it was, and what I wanted it to look like by the time I join [the 27 Club](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/the-27-club-a-brief-history-17853/)(back then, it wasn't really a joke to me).

This morning I checked my email which was full of freebies from [birthdayclubs.com](https://www.heyitsfree.net/birthday-freebies/) wishing me a "Happy 'Half Birthday'!" and it dawned on me that I was checking my email in the morning for a quick hit of dopamine (although much better than social media). Before locking and chucking my phone in a drawer, I checked with my friend that we were still going to the opening day of [The Baltimore Farmer's Market](https://farmersmarketbaltimore.org).

From there, I knew I was going to have a day of intention. 

I read (1) a few paragraphs of the [*The Wim Hof Method*](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/the-wim-hof-method-book) before rolling out my yoga mat and set a timer to stretch and meditate for 20 minutes (2). After my practice, my joints snapped and cracked almost knowingly as I took off my clothes and started a load of laundry (3) while my coffee steeped (4). When the wash cycle finished I was dressed and headed out the door to meet my friend.

Although it seems as if I had an auspicious morning, I was still late to meet my friend by about 15 minutes (5) and I did not have breakfast (6).

I found him at the performance stage playing [local house music DJs](https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/baltimore-farmers-market-kicks-off-46th-season-sunday-with-house-djs/) and he greeted me by asking if I wanted a tequila shot. "Oh, um, at 10:30 in the morning?" I asked obtusely. He told me how this woman had coerced him to purchase a shot, and in the spirit of people-pleasing (7) and feeling at ease in social situations, I almost accepted. I declined and told him my boring story of my blood results from a month ago and kept my streak strong (8). We agreed, however, that we would be having beers in the warmer months as they are still my favorite drink (9). 

As we made the rounds, I first stopped by the apple vendor to ask about the delicious ["Ludacrisp"](https://fruitgrowersnews.com/article/four-new-apple-varieties-released-maia/). Unfortunately, they would not be in season until six months from now, in October. However, the vendor recognized both of us from the climbing gym and told us that the Evercrisp is from the same family and gave us an apple to try. We gave him our smile and told us to come climb with us sometime (10). We went to the knife vendor and asked to use one of their knives to cut the apple in half (11) brimming with succulent juice retained by the freshest apple I've had in a long time.

The morning went by quickly as we continued walking around the farmer's market, talking and browsing. He bought us each a bag of tea, and I bought us a croissant to split (12) and an apple danish and cinnamon roll for later (13). My friend, doing a post-doctorate at Hopkins, bemoaned that he had to prepare for a conference and went home. He encouraged me to pursue a Master's (14) since it was a lot less work. Despite that sunny day, I was still freezing in a hoodie (15) and returned home as well. With the laundry done and the week's chores completed, I finished the rest of my pastries and headed to the gym. 

While my mind was apt for a challenge, my body was not aligned with enthusiasm. I had slept poorly the night before (16) and I was nursing a shin splint. I headed straight for the squat rack and loaded it for back squats, arguably the most reliable exercise. In the 4 years I have been lifting seriously, I felt that my progress had platued in the last half. Given I was training for different reasons from then to now and the unforeseen impact of COVID-19, I gave myself credit for coming this far (17). After some time trying to convince my body to wake up, I laced up my running shoes (18) and queued my current favorite songs (19) and ran a 5K (20) at a decent pace, despite my body's complaints. I ran into some friends and climbed a few routes, but quickly ran out of energy and headed home (21) to give myself time to meet up with them again for dinner. From the day's activities and remembering the Wim Hof method, I took a frigid shower (22). 

We planned to meet at this pizza place they hyped up for days at 7:30, but found out they close at 8 on Sundays (23). The group headed to another pizza place a few blocks over (24) and many of my friends remarked that it felt like a long time since they saw me around. There were about 12 of us, so dinner was around 2 hours of joking around and sharing food and stories. While I was tempted to order dessert (25), I knew I made a commitment to write for *Solaria Chip* and went home to begin my article after a long day of reflection (26). In the next six months, I will
