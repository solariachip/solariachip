Bread is one of my favorite foods. It’s so simple, so versatile. At its purest form it consists of just two ingredients: flour and water. Its history, however, is as complex as it gets. The history of bread dates back to the Epipaleolithic time, which occurred around 14,000 years ago. For a very long time we thought the first bread baking took place much later than this, during the Neolithic ages. It wasn’t until recently, [when archaeologists discovered ancient bread crumbs at an excavation site in Jordan](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/07/24/631583427/14-000-year-old-piece-of-bread-rewrites-the-history-of-baking-and-farming), that we realized how rich the history of bread really is. This new unravelment of bread’s history was puzzling to us, as it showed that our ancestors learned how to bake before they even learned how to farm. As society became more complex, so did bread’s abundance of symbolisms. The more I learn about bread, it is clear that it is not just a food. It is a symbol of love, war, peace, religion. Some bakers and chefs may even call it an art form. 

Throughout human history, bread has been held on a high pedestal in every corner of civilization. It helped fuel the backbone of humanity, and for many people, gave meaning to life itself. Bread held so much significance that certain beliefs and superstitions were created around it. For example, there is an ancient belief that serving bread upside down on a table attracts evil spirits. In ancient Egypt, loaves of bread were placed in tombs of the dead in order to ensure longevity in the afterlife. 


Bread was also considered a symbol of sexuality in some cultures. In Sicily, for example, they held fertility festivals where women were given bread to celebrate their “oneness” with the earth that supposedly came from their knowledge of procreation. Even in the US, the birth of the store bought bread “Wonderbread” was inspired by an [1883 poster for a brand of processed flour](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=WHIC&u=nysl_li_liu&id=GALE%7CCX3403400088&v=2.1&it=r&sid=bookmark-WHIC&asid=b621d9c9), where a woman is seen dressed quite flirtatiously while advertising the brand. This was around the time when industry was about to completely transform how we made bread. Unfortunately, more efficient means of production also correlated with a decline in quality. The “a few simple ingredients” version of bread humanity had enjoyed for thousands of years was all of a sudden filled with highly processed  filler ingredients, and this was reflected in the taste and texture. To quote the absolute culinary legend Julia Childs, “How can a nation be great if its bread tastes like Kleenex?”

Luckily, artisan bread has been [making a comeback in the world recently](https://commercialbaking.com/the-dough-in-dough-pandemic-yields-rising-interest-in-artisan-bread/), especially for me during COVID lockdown when I had nothing better to do but bake. Hopefully the trend continues, as there’s nothing more comforting than the simplicity of a freshly made loaf of bread. You’re probably thinking “Calm down, it’s just bread.” But I sincerely hope that we continue the path of going back to our roots and learning more about the culture and history of bread-making. And bread should not just be passively eaten without a second thought. It should be an experience, something that brings people together and evokes emotion. To quote Robert Browning,

>“If thou tastest a crust of bread, thou tastest all the stars and all the heavens.”
