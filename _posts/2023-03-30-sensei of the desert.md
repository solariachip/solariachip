<i>I have secured my place in this beautiful wasteland

<i>Unphased by the passing of time, I wait for answers under the shade of the sun

<i>Limited but limitless in my attempt

<i>To understand what it means to exist

<i>In a place that holds little life

<br>               

<i>Always clear nights to gather wisdom from the stars

<i>So those who eat my flesh go mad with my secrets

<i>A piece of me may be lost

<i>But I must sacrifice myself so you may know the truth

<i>This is my curse but a blessing to provide a beacon for those who dare not touch me

<br>               

<i>What a world, to be exposed but feel so safe

<i>Impossibly immortal in my element

<i>I am the sensei of the desert

<br>
