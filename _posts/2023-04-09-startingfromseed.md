In one of my [recent posts](https://solariachip.github.io/spring/) I mentioned that one of my favorite things about the Spring season is being able to garden again. This season I’m starting my garden from seed, which is something I haven’t done before, so I thought it would fun to document the process and turn it into a *Solaria Chip* post. This weekend I started with an herb kit that my mom picked out (thanks mom) consisting of basil, cilantro, and chives (some of my favorites). If it’s your first time sowing seeds, it really helps to start with a kit because it comes with everything you need and gives you instructions. This one came with a planter, 3 soil pucks, and the seeds. 


You start by first soaking the soil pucks in some water in a bowl and letting them expand.

After a few minutes you can use a fork and break apart the pucks to the point where it looks like normal soil.

Then I spread the dirt evenly into the planter and sowed the seeds in ¼-inch deep into the soil, making sure the seeds had their own section of the planter.

I then stuck a few labels on the planter so I could remember where I placed each type of seed, and I placed some plastic wrap over it. The air-tight environment will help to maintain humidity as the seeds start to germinate. After a few weeks I will have sprouts come up which is very exciting!

My next project was to plant some kale and two varieties of tomatoes (galinas and carmello) that my grandpa sent me. He plants these in his garden as well and they are very fresh and delicious. I used these 4x3 planters that come with lids and a light source to help maintain the humid, bright environment that the seeds need to germinate. I repeated the same process of soaking soil pucks in water and putting each one into its own slot. I then sowed 2-4 seeds into each slot (as per the instructions), put the lids on, and then plugged in the lights. After about a month they will be ready to be transplanted outside!

I can’t wait to enjoy some fresh herbs and vegetables from the garden. I love growing my own food around this time of year because it is sustainable, healthy, and way cheaper than going to the store. 

Happy Easter and happy gardening!
