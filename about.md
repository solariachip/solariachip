# *About Solaria Chip*
---
Just as the name is an *anagram* of Carli Sophia, the human experience is a mixture of ideas and finding all the ways to connect with one another and live a meaningful life. Every day, Solaria Chip provides nourishing nibbles on culture, science, health, climate, lifestyle, philosophy, and anything under the Sun!

### *About Carli*
My name is **Carli Smith**, a graduate student fueled by caffeine and the pursuit of adventure. We all know the internet can be a very negative place sometimes -- my personal mission for this blog is to counteract that by offering people a space to learn, laugh, be introspective, open their minds, and maybe even relate in some way. My partner-in-crime Sophia and I are absolutely stoked to post daily to share our experiences, passions, offer different perspectives, and most importantly have fun doing it! We hope you enjoy.

### *About Sophia*
**Sophia Medallon** tries to live up to her name by consuming the wisdoms the world has to offer. Seeming to vacillate between hobbies and interests, she models after a Renaissance woman and enjoys the pursuit of knowledge in a time when it has never been so accessible. With a deep interest in anything that ellicits passion and beauty, Sophia was drawn to creating an articulate space with Carli, a vibrant and inspiring woman who never fails to match her own energy.

### Roots
S & C met during their undergraduate careers on the beautiful coast of Santa Cruz, California, where they were in the same research group studying astrophysical transients. During lockdown, they spent their days getting burritos on the beach and trying to understand the challenges ahead in this pivotal moment in their lives. Carli now studies fusion at Penn State and Sophia supports the Hubble Space Telescope in Baltimore, MD. The two embark on a new chapter in two different states, away from familiar territory with new challenges, but greater opportunities and development. This project brings them an incredible amount of joy and a chance to elevate themselves and others reading the blog.
